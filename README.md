# Punched qubit chain

In this project I use qiskit 1.0 to investigate what happens to a chain of 3 qubits, where one of the end-tip qubits is submit to periodic measurements.

The main tools used are:

- Quantum trajectories
- Qiskit primitives
- Time-evolution in qiskit
- VQE in qiskit

This is one of the projects of my PhD research. If you have any question, feel free to send me an email: bentomontenegro@gmail.com
