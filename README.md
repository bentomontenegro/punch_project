# Bento Montenegro's PhD project

Hi, friends.

This repo is intended to publicly share Qiskit implementations of the main tools I'm using in the development of my PhD project (for example, time evolution and quantum trajectories).

Of course not all information is given, but hopefully the codes and the explanations can help those who are trying to implement similar concepts in Qiskit.

Any suggestions, PR's or comments are more than welcome.
