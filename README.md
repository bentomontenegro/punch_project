# Introduction

The investigation of energy flows across spin chains is fundamental for understanding the architecture and improving connectivity setups of today's quantum processors. In this project we explore a basic Ising-like spin chain where the two end-tip qubits are subject to periodic quantum measurements.

The tools used are:

- Qiskit Runtime with local simulators and real backends
- Qiskit Estimator Primitive and CouplingMap methods
- Qiskit trotterization for efficient time-evolution
- Qiskit error mitigation techniques
- Quantum trajectories to account for stochastic effects

This is one of the projects of my PhD research. If you have any question, feel free to send me an email: bentomontenegro@gmail.com.
